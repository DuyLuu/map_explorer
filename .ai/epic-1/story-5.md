# Epic-1: SDK Foundation
# Story-5: Documentation Framework

## Story
**As a** developer using the SDK (or the SDK development team)
**I want** a framework for generating and hosting developer documentation
**so that** API references, guides, and tutorials are accessible and maintainable.

## Status: Draft

## Context & Background
This story focuses on setting up the tooling and structure for generating technical documentation from source code comments (e.g., DocC for Swift, KDoc/Dokka for Kotlin) and establishing a place to host guides and tutorials (e.g., within the `/docs` directory, potentially using a static site generator).

## Story Points: 3

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and choose documentation generation tools for iOS/Swift (likely DocC).
- [ ] Research and choose documentation generation tools for Android/Kotlin (likely Dokka).
- [ ] Configure build system (SwiftPM/Gradle) to integrate doc generation tools.
- [ ] Define structure for guides and tutorials within the `/docs` directory.
- [ ] (Optional) Select and configure a static site generator (e.g., MkDocs, Jekyll, Docusaurus) for hosting `/docs` content.
- [ ] Add basic placeholder comments in source code (iOS & Android) compatible with chosen tools.
- [ ] Add initial structure to `/docs` (e.g., `index.md`, `getting-started.md`).
- [ ] Integrate documentation generation into CI/CD pipeline (basic step).

## Dev Notes
- Focus on setting up the framework, not writing extensive documentation yet.
- Ensure generated API docs and manually written guides can coexist.
