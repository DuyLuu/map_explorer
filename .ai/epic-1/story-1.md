# Epic-1: SDK Foundation
# Story-1: Project Setup & Architecture

## Story
**As a** developer lead
**I want** the basic project structure, build systems, and initial architecture defined
**so that** the team can start building the core SDK infrastructure.

## Status: Draft

## Context & Background
This story covers the initial setup required before development on the SDK features can begin. It includes repository initialization, documentation creation (PRD, Architecture), directory structure definition, and basic build system setup.

## Story Points: 3

## Tasks
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Define directory structure (documented in `.ai/arch.md`)
- [x] Create initial PRD (`.ai/prd.md`)
- [x] Create initial Architecture document (`.ai/arch.md`)
- [x] Setup basic build system placeholders for iOS (SwiftPM `Package.swift`)
- [x] Setup basic build system placeholders for Android (Gradle files)
- [ ] Establish basic CI/CD pipeline structure (TBD)

## Dev Notes
- Initial setup phase.
- Focused on documentation and project scaffolding.
- Build system files will be basic placeholders initially.
- CI/CD setup will be addressed in more detail in Story-2.
