# PRD: Moneta Mobile SDK

## Status: Draft

## Introduction
The Moneta Mobile SDK is a native library that provides financial services functionality for integration into iOS and Android applications. This SDK will encapsulate the core financial features of the Moneta mobile app, exposing them through a clean, consistent API that can be used by third-party developers.

The SDK will be implemented natively in Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android to provide optimal performance, security, and platform-specific user experiences while maintaining feature parity with the existing Flutter application.

## Goals
- Provide a secure, performant native SDK for financial services
- Enable third-party developers to integrate Moneta's financial capabilities
- Maintain feature parity with the existing Moneta mobile application
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines and best practices
- Create a developer-friendly API with comprehensive documentation
- Ensure robust security, privacy, and compliance with financial regulations
