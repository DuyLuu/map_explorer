# Epic-5: Challenge Mode
# Story-1: Challenge Mode Architecture

## Story
**As a** dedicated student
**I want** a challenging quiz mode that combines map and flag questions
**so that** I can test my comprehensive geography knowledge

## Status: Draft

## Context & Background
The Challenge Mode offers an advanced difficulty level by combining map and flag quizzes, with 300 random questions and no tolerance for wrong answers.

## Story Points: 8

## Tasks
1. - [ ] Design challenge mode architecture
   1. - [ ] Define data structures for combined quiz types
   2. - [ ] Create question selection algorithm
   3. - [ ] Design zero-mistake system
2. - [ ] Implement question randomization
   1. - [ ] Create 300-question set generator
   2. - [ ] Balance question types
   3. - [ ] Ensure region diversity
3. - [ ] Build challenge mode flow
   1. - [ ] Start/end challenge mechanics
   2. - [ ] Implement game-over on first mistake
   3. - [ ] Create progress tracking
4. - [ ] Implement scoring system
   1. - [ ] Design score calculation algorithm
   2. - [ ] Create top score storage
   3. - [ ] Build simple leaderboard
5. - [ ] Create tests
   1. - [ ] Unit tests for challenge mode logic
   2. - [ ] Integration tests for full challenge flow

## Dev Notes
- Ensure question randomization is truly random but balanced
- Consider increasing difficulty as challenge progresses
- Design UI to clearly indicate challenge mode vs regular quizzes
- Optimize for performance to handle 300 questions smoothly
